# Extraction Pattern Fix Summary

## Problem Statement

The user reported issues with the discharge summary extraction where:

1. **Admitting Diagnosis** was filled with a long narrative paragraph about symptoms instead of the actual diagnosis:
   ```
   Admitting Diagnosis: occasionally led to frustration on his part. He denies 
   associated headaches, focal weakness, seizures, visual disturbances, dysphagia, 
   or nausea and vomiting. There have been no recent falls, loss of consciousness, 
   or other new neurologic symptoms. Persistence of symptoms prompted consult at GRH...
   ```

2. **Procedures** were showing incomplete/corrupted entries:
   ```
   PROCEDURES PERFORMED
   1. progress
   2. (s) (LRB):
   3. (s) (LRB):
   ```

3. **PMH items** appeared to be confused with "Reason for Admission"

## Root Causes

### 1. Overly Greedy Regex Patterns
The admitting diagnosis pattern was:
```javascript
/(?:Chief Complaint|CC|Presenting Problem|Reason for Admission|Admitting Diagnosis)\s*:?\s*([^\n]+)/i
```

The `([^\n]+)` captured everything to end of line, including long narrative paragraphs.

### 2. No Content Validation
There was no validation to check if the captured text was actually a diagnosis vs. clinical narrative.

### 3. Insufficient Procedure Validation
Procedures were accepted if they were just 10+ characters and had 2+ words, allowing invalid entries like "progress" (only 8 chars but was being captured from semantic analysis).

### 4. No Medical Context Checking
The semantic analysis would extract single procedure-related words without ensuring they were part of complete procedure descriptions.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Stricter Admitting Diagnosis Pattern

**Changes:**
```javascript
// Old: Captured anything including "Reason for Admission"
/(?:Chief Complaint|CC|Presenting Problem|Reason for Admission|Admitting Diagnosis)\s*:?\s*([^\n]+)/i

// New: More targeted, with length limits
/(?:Admitting Diagnosis|Primary Diagnosis)\s*:?\s*([^\n]{1,200}?)(?=\n|$)/i
```

**Added Validation:**
```javascript
if (admitDxMatch && admitDxMatch[1]) {
  const captured = admitDxMatch[1].trim();
  // Reject if it looks like narrative text
  if (captured.match(/\b(he|she|patient|denies|reports|states|presents with|led to|his|her)\b/i) || 
      captured.length > 100 || 
      captured.split(/[.!?]/).length > 2) {
    admitDxMatch = null; // Invalid, looks like narrative
  }
}
```

**Result:** Rejects narrative text that contains:
- Personal pronouns (he/she/his/her)
- Clinical reporting verbs (denies/reports/states)
- Multiple sentences
- Text longer than 100 characters

### 2. Enhanced Procedure Extraction

**Multi-line Pattern Support:**
```javascript
// Pattern 1: Same-line procedures (min 15 chars)
/(?:Procedure|Operation|Surgery|Operative Procedure)(?!\(s\)\s*\([A-Z]+\)\s*:)\s*:?\s*([^\n]{15,})/gi

// Pattern 2: Next-line procedures (handles "Post-Op Procedure(s) (LRB):\n[actual procedure]")
/(?:Post-?Op(?:erative)?\s+)?(?:Procedure|Operation|Surgery)\s*(?:\(s\))?\s*(?:\([A-Z]+\))?\s*:\s*\n([^\n]{15,})/gi
```

**Comprehensive Validation:**
```javascript
.filter(proc => {
  const hasMinLength = proc.length >= 15;  // Increased from 10
  const notJustAbbrev = !proc.match(/^[\(\)\s\w]{1,5}$/);
  const notCommonWords = !proc.match(/^(progress|notes?|s|LRB|RRB|...)$/i);
  const hasMultipleWords = proc.replace(/[^\w\s]/g, '').split(/\s+/).filter(w => w.length > 2).length >= 2;
  const hasMedicalTerm = proc.match(/\b(craniotomy|craniectomy|laminectomy|discectomy|fusion|biopsy|...)$/i);
  
  return hasMinLength && notJustAbbrev && notCommonWords && hasMultipleWords && hasMedicalTerm;
});
```

**Result:** Only accepts procedures that:
- Are at least 15 characters long
- Contain recognized medical procedure terms
- Have multiple meaningful words (>2 chars each)
- Are not common non-procedure words

### 3. Improved Semantic Procedure Extraction

**Context-Aware Extraction:**
```javascript
// Old: Just captured the matched word
const procedure = match[1] || match[0];

// New: Looks for complete procedure phrases in context
const contextMatch = (before + after).match(/\b([A-Z]?\d?[-\s]?[A-Z]?\d?\s+)?(\w+\s+)?(craniotomy|craniectomy|...)/i);
```

**Result:** Captures complete descriptions like "Left Minicraniotomy" instead of just "Minicraniotomy".

## Test Coverage

Created comprehensive test suite with 10 tests covering:

1. **Admitting Diagnosis Tests:**
   - ✅ Rejects long narrative paragraphs
   - ✅ Validates and rejects narrative markers
   - ✅ Accepts valid short diagnoses

2. **Procedure Tests:**
   - ✅ Rejects "progress" as procedure
   - ✅ Rejects abbreviations like "(s) (LRB):"
   - ✅ Extracts valid multi-word procedures with medical terms
   - ✅ Requires medical terminology

3. **Integration Tests:**
   - ✅ Full clinical note extraction
   - ✅ PMH vs Reason for Admission separation
   - ✅ Discharge diagnosis extraction

All tests pass (10/10).

## Results

### Before Fix:
- **Admitting Diagnosis**: "occasionally led to frustration on his part. He denies associated headaches..." (WRONG - narrative text)
- **Procedures**: "progress", "(s) (LRB):" (WRONG - incomplete fragments)

### After Fix:
- **Admitting Diagnosis**: "tumor" ✅ (or "Brain tumor" when explicitly stated)
- **Discharge Diagnosis**: "tumor, glioma, seizures" ✅
- **Procedures**: "Left Minicraniotomy, Open Biopsy of Tumor, Duraplasty, Image Guidance and Microscope (Left)" ✅
- **PMH**: Correctly extracted as separate items ✅

## Impact

- **Accuracy**: Significantly improved extraction accuracy for diagnoses and procedures
- **Reliability**: Added validation prevents invalid data from being accepted
- **Robustness**: Handles various clinical note formats including multi-line procedures
- **User Experience**: Users no longer see corrupted or incorrect data in generated summaries

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/DischargeSummaryGenerator.jsx` - Core extraction logic improvements
2. `src/components/DischargeSummaryGenerator.extraction-fix.test.jsx` - New comprehensive test suite

## Backward Compatibility

All existing tests pass. The changes are additive (more validation) rather than breaking, so they should work with existing clinical notes while preventing the specific issues reported.
