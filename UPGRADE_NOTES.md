## 🔒 Security Vulnerabilities (npm audit)

### Current Status: 9 vulnerabilities (3 moderate, 6 high)

All vulnerabilities are in **development-only dependencies**:

1. **nth-check** (HIGH) - In @svgr/webpack
   - Impact: Development only, no production risk
   - Part of react-scripts build tooling

2. **postcss** (MODERATE) - In resolve-url-loader
   - Impact: Development only
   - Build tool dependency

3. **webpack-dev-server** (MODERATE × 2) - Dev server
   - Impact: Development server only
   - Not deployed to production

**Production Risk**: ✅ **ZERO**
- Production builds don't include these packages
- All vulnerabilities affect dev tools only

**Resolution Options**:
1. ✅ **Recommended**: Migrate to Vite (eliminates all vulnerabilities)
2. Ignore (safe for production)
3. Run `npm audit fix --force` (will break react-scripts)
