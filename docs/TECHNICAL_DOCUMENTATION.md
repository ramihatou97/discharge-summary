## 3. Core Algorithms & Functions

### 3.1 Data Extraction System

#### Pattern-Based Extraction (`extractWithPatterns`)
**Algorithm**: Regex-based Named Entity Recognition (NER)

```javascript
Input: Clinical notes (free text)
Process:
1. Text preprocessing and normalization
2. Abbreviation expansion using medical dictionary (500+ terms)
3. Pattern matching using 100+ regex patterns
4. Confidence scoring for each extracted field
5. Deduplication and entity resolution

Output: Structured data object with 40+ fields
```

**Key Patterns**:
- Patient Demographics: `/(Name|Patient|Pt):?\s*([A-Z][a-z]+\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)/i`
- Age: `/(\d+)\s*(?:yo|year old|y\.?o\.?)/i`
- Dates: `/(\d{1,2}[/-]\d{1,2}[/-]\d{2,4})/`
- Medications: `/(\w+)\s+(\d+)\s*(mg|mcg|ml)/i`
- Diagnoses: `/(?:Diagnosis|Dx):?\s*([^\n]+)/i`

**Confidence Calculation**:
```
base_confidence = 0.7
+ pattern_specificity_boost (0.0-0.3)
+ medical_term_boost (0.15)
+ training_data_boost (0.0-0.2)
- length_penalty (0.0-0.2)
- correction_history_penalty (0.0-0.1)
= final_confidence (0.1-0.99)
```

#### AI-Powered Extraction (`extractWithAI`)
**Algorithm**: LLM-based structured extraction

```javascript
Process:
1. Construct detailed prompt with clinical context
2. Define JSON schema for structured output
3. Call Google Gemini API with temperature=0.1 (deterministic)
4. Parse JSON response
5. Fallback to pattern matching on failure
6. Validate and merge with pattern-based results

Advantages:
- Handles complex clinical narratives
- Better context understanding
- Extracts implicit information
- Higher accuracy on ambiguous cases
```

### 3.2 Medical Abbreviation Expansion

**Function**: `expandAbbreviations(text)`

**Algorithm**:
1. Load 500+ neurosurgery-specific abbreviations
2. Apply word boundary matching: `\b${abbr}\b`
3. Preserve medical context (dosages, measurements)
4. Update expansion confidence based on usage patterns
5. Learn new abbreviations from corrections

**Coverage**:
- Vascular: SAH, AVM, DAVF, CCF, ICA, MCA, ACA, PCA
- Pathology: SDH, EDH, ICH, IPH, IVH
- Procedures: EVD, VPS, ETV, Crani, Lami
- Monitoring: ICP, CPP, TCD, EEG, EMG
- Medications: ASA, Keppra, PCN, ABX

### 3.3 Clinical Condition Detection

**Function**: `detectConditions(text)`

**Algorithm**: Multi-criteria pattern matching with clinical guidelines integration

```javascript
For each condition category:
1. Primary pattern matching (disease names, ICD codes)
2. Secondary pattern matching (symptoms, findings)
3. Severity classification (mild/moderate/severe/critical)
4. Guidelines lookup from evidence database
5. Calculate confidence score
6. Attach treatment protocols

Conditions Detected:
- Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)
- Subdural Hematoma (SDH)
- Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)
- Brain Tumor
- Spinal Disorders
- Hydrocephalus
- Aneurysm
- Stroke/CVA
```

### 3.4 Procedure Extraction & Classification

**Function**: `extractDetailedProcedures(text)`

**Algorithm**:
1. Identify procedure keywords and surgical terms
2. Extract operative details (date, duration, EBL)
3. Map to CPT codes for billing
4. Classify by type (major/minor, neurosurgical/diagnostic)
5. Extract complications and follow-up needs
6. Calculate confidence based on documentation completeness

**Procedure Types**:
- Craniotomy (CPT: 61510-61546)
- EVD Placement (CPT: 61210)
- VP Shunt (CPT: 62223)
- Spinal Fusion (CPT: 22630-22632)
- Aneurysm Clipping (CPT: 61697-61700)

### 3.5 Named Entity Recognition (NER)

**Function**: `extractEntities(text, entityType)`

**Algorithm**: Hybrid pattern + context-aware extraction

```javascript
Steps:
1. Split text into sentences
2. For each entity type (medications, labs, diagnoses):
   a. Apply specialized regex patterns
   b. Use context clues (preceding/following words)
   c. Validate against medical dictionaries
   d. Calculate entity-specific confidence
   e. Deduplicate and rank by confidence
3. Sort by relevance and confidence
4. Return top N entities with metadata

Entity Types:
- Medications: Name, dose, route, frequency
- Lab Values: Test name, value, units, date
- Diagnoses: Primary, secondary, ICD codes
- Vital Signs: BP, HR, RR, Temp, O2Sat
```

## 5. Machine Learning Components

### 5.1 Self-Improving Model

**Concept**: Continuous learning from user corrections

**Algorithm**:
```javascript
Training Process:
1. User corrects extracted field
2. Record: {original, corrected, field, timestamp}
3. Update pattern frequency map
4. Adjust confidence weights
5. Recalculate accuracy metrics
6. Persist to localStorage

Pattern Learning:
patterns[field:value] = frequency_count

Accuracy Calculation:
accuracy = min(98, 70 + (total_samples * 0.5))
```

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Overall accuracy (starts at 70%, improves to 98%)
- Specialty-specific accuracy (neurosurgery, spine, vascular, etc.)
- Entity-level precision/recall/F1
- Extraction time and speed
- User satisfaction scores

### 5.2 Confidence Scoring System

**Function**: `calculateEntityConfidence(text, entityType)`

**Multi-factor scoring**:
```javascript
confidence = base_confidence (0.7)
           + training_boost (0.0-0.2)    // from historical accuracy
           - correction_penalty (0.0-0.1) // if frequently corrected
           + medical_boost (0.15)         // if in medical dictionary
           + length_penalty (-0.2-0.0)    // very short = less confident
           + context_boost (0.0-0.1)      // surrounding medical context
           
Final range: 0.1 to 0.99 (never 0 or 1)
```

### 5.3 Training Data Structure

```javascript
{
  patterns: {
    "medications:levetiracetam": 45,  // frequency count
    "diagnoses:sah": 32,
    "procedures:craniotomy": 28
  },
  corrections: [
    {
      timestamp: 1234567890,

      corrected: "John Smith"
    }
  ],
  accuracy: {
    current: 85.5,
    history: [70, 75, 78, 82, 85.5]
  },
  totalSamples: 150,

## 8. Technical Implementation Details

### 8.1 Performance Optimization

**Techniques Used**:
1. **Memoization**: `useMemo` for expensive computations
2. **Callback Optimization**: `useCallback` to prevent re-renders
3. **Debouncing**: Auto-save with 2-second delay
4. **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded on-demand
5. **Local Storage**: Caching for offline capability

### 8.2 Error Handling

**Strategy**: Graceful degradation with fallbacks
- AI extraction fails → Fallback to pattern matching
- API unavailable → Offline mode continues
- Invalid data → User warnings, not blocking errors
- Missing fields → Highlighted for manual entry

### 8.3 Data Privacy & Security

**HIPAA Considerations**:
1. **Local Processing**: Primary extraction runs client-side
2. **No Data Storage**: No server-side PHI storage
3. **Optional AI**: User controls when data sent to API
4. **Auto-save**: localStorage only, user-controlled
5. **No Analytics**: No tracking of medical data
