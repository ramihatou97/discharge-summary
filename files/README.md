## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

**This application is a prototype and NOT approved for clinical use.** Key limitations:
- Not FDA-approved or CE-marked
- No HIPAA compliance verification
- No clinical validation studies
- Requires physician review of all outputs
- 70-90% accuracy (13-30% error rate)

**Use for educational and demonstration purposes only.**

## Features

- **Multi-modal extraction**: Pattern-based (regex) + optional AI enhancement
- **Neurosurgery specialization**: 500+ medical abbreviations, specialty templates
- **Risk assessments**: Seizure, VTE, and readmission risk calculators
- **Evidence-based recommendations**: Clinical guidelines integrated
- **Self-learning system**: Improves from user corrections
- **Auto-save**: Never lose your work
- **Multiple templates**: Neurosurgery, standard, and brief formats
- **Dark mode support**: Reduce eye strain
- **Print-ready**: Professional formatting for medical records

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)
1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. Import your forked repository
4. Deploy with one click

### Option 2: Deploy to Netlify
1. Fork this repository
2. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
3. Connect your GitHub and select the repository
4. Deploy automatically

### Option 3: Local Development
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ramihatou97/discharge-summary-generator.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Input Clinical Notes**
   - Paste admission note (patient demographics, HPI, admission diagnosis)
   - Add operative note (surgical details, complications)
   - Add progress notes (daily updates, hospital course)
   - Add final/discharge note (discharge planning, medications)

2. **Extract Information**
   - Click "Extract Information" to process the notes
   - System extracts 40+ structured data fields
   - Review confidence scores (green=high, yellow=medium, red=low)
   - Correct any errors (helps train the system)

3. **Review Risk Assessments**
   - Seizure risk (for neurosurgical patients)
   - VTE risk (blood clot prevention)
   - Readmission risk prediction

4. **Generate Summary**
   - Select template (neurosurgery/standard/brief)
   - Click "Generate Summary" to create discharge document
   - Review evidence-based recommendations
   - Copy, download, or print the final summary

### How It Works

The app uses two extraction methods:
- **Pattern Matching** (always active): Fast, offline, ~70-80% accurate
- **AI Enhancement** (optional): Slower, requires API key, ~85-90% accurate

For detailed explanation of all algorithms and functions, see [Technical Documentation](../TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md).

## AI Integration (Optional)

To enable AI-powered extraction:
1. Get a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Enable "Use AI Extraction" in settings
3. Enter your API key

**Privacy Note**: When AI extraction is enabled, clinical notes are sent to Google's servers. This may not be HIPAA-compliant without a Business Associate Agreement (BAA). Use pattern-only extraction for sensitive data.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18.2.0
- **UI Components**: Lucide-react icons
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.3.0
- **AI (optional)**: Google Gemini API
- **Data Processing**: Client-side (browser-based)
- **Storage**: localStorage (auto-save)

## Architecture Overview

```
Input (8 note types) 
  ‚Üí Preprocessing (abbreviation expansion)
  ‚Üí Extraction (pattern matching + optional AI)
  ‚Üí Validation (completeness checking)
  ‚Üí Risk Assessment (3 calculators)
  ‚Üí Recommendations (evidence-based)
  ‚Üí Output (formatted summary)
```

For complete architecture details, see [Technical Documentation](../TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md).

## Accuracy & Limitations

### Extraction Accuracy
- **Pattern matching**: 70-80% baseline accuracy
- **AI enhancement**: 85-90% accuracy
- **With training**: Improves to 87%+ over time

### Known Limitations
- ‚ùå Not FDA-approved medical device
- ‚ùå No HIPAA compliance verification
- ‚ùå No clinical validation studies
- ‚ùå No drug interaction checking
- ‚ùå No EHR integration
- ‚ùå Requires manual review of all outputs
- ‚ùå Single-user machine learning (no collaborative learning)
