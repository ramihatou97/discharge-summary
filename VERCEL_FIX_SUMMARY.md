# Vercel MIME Type Issue - Fix Summary

## Overview
Fixed critical MIME type errors preventing the application from loading on Vercel deployments. The browser was refusing to load CSS and JavaScript files because they were being served with incorrect MIME types (`text/html` instead of `text/css` and `application/javascript`).

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `vercel.json` (1 line changed)
**File**: `/vercel.json`

**Change**: Modified the rewrite rule to exclude static assets

```diff
- "source": "/:path*",
+ "source": "/((?!assets/|.*\\.(js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|svg|woff|woff2|ttf|eot)).*)",
```

**Purpose**: 
- Prevents Vercel from rewriting requests for static assets to `/index.html`
- Uses negative lookahead regex to exclude asset paths and file extensions
- Preserves SPA routing for actual client-side routes

### 2. Updated `vite.config.js` (1 line changed)
**File**: `/vite.config.js`

**Change**: Made base path environment-aware

```diff
- base: '/discharge-summary/',
+ base: process.env.VERCEL ? '/' : '/discharge-summary/',
```

**Purpose**:
- Automatically uses `/` base path when deploying to Vercel
- Keeps `/discharge-summary/` base path for GitHub Pages
- No manual configuration needed when switching between platforms

## Technical Details

### The Problem
1. **Overly broad rewrite**: The original `"source": "/:path*"` pattern matched ALL requests, including static assets
2. **Wrong base path**: Assets were prefixed with `/discharge-summary/` which doesn't exist on Vercel root deployments
3. **Result**: Requests for `/discharge-summary/assets/style.css` were rewritten to `/index.html`, returning HTML with `text/html` MIME type

### The Solution
1. **Selective rewriting**: New regex excludes paths starting with `assets/` and paths ending with static file extensions
2. **Environment detection**: Uses `process.env.VERCEL` to automatically set correct base path
3. **Result**: Static assets are served directly with correct MIME types, SPA routing still works

## Verification

### Build Output Comparison

**Vercel build** (with `VERCEL=1`):
```html
<script type="module" crossorigin src="/assets/index-CkpgiJjM.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" crossorigin href="/assets/index-CLtjZZEa.css">
```

**GitHub Pages build** (without `VERCEL`):
```html
<script type="module" crossorigin src="/discharge-summary/assets/index-CkpgiJjM.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" crossorigin href="/discharge-summary/assets/index-CLtjZZEa.css">
```

### MIME Type Verification
- CSS files: ✅ `Content-Type: text/css`
- JS files: ✅ `Content-Type: text/javascript`
- HTML: ✅ `Content-Type: text/html`

### Tests
- ✅ All 77 tests passing
- ✅ No functionality broken
- ✅ Build succeeds for both platforms

## Deployment Instructions

### For Vercel
1. Push changes to the branch connected to Vercel
2. Vercel automatically detects the `VERCEL` environment variable
3. Build uses base path `/`
4. Assets served with correct MIME types
5. **No manual configuration required** ✅

### For GitHub Pages
1. Run `npm run deploy` as usual
2. Build uses base path `/discharge-summary/`
3. Assets deployed to correct GitHub Pages path
4. **No changes needed to existing workflow** ✅

## Impact

### Before Fix
- ❌ CSS not loading (MIME type error)
- ❌ JavaScript not loading (MIME type error)
- ❌ Blank page on Vercel
- ❌ Console full of errors

### After Fix
- ✅ All assets load correctly
- ✅ Proper MIME types
- ✅ Application works on Vercel
- ✅ GitHub Pages deployment unaffected
- ✅ No manual configuration needed

## Files Changed
1. `vercel.json` - Updated rewrite rule (1 line)
2. `vite.config.js` - Added environment detection (1 line)
3. `docs/VERCEL_MIME_TYPE_FIX.md` - Detailed technical documentation (new)
4. `docs/VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Updated with fix reference (3 lines)

**Total changes**: 2 functional lines + documentation

## Conclusion
The fix is minimal, surgical, and automatic. It requires no manual intervention for future deployments to either Vercel or GitHub Pages. The solution leverages Vercel's built-in environment variables to provide a seamless multi-platform deployment experience.
